# FindWork Backend

This project provides the backend services for a job board application, enabling the management of job listings through a RESTful API.

## About

The FindWork backend is built using Java and Spring Boot. It provides core functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting job postings.

## Technologies Used

*   Java 17+
*   Spring Boot 3.x
*   Spring Data JPA
*   H2 Database (In-Memory for development)
*   Maven

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [invalid URL removed]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd find-work-backend
    ```
3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install

4.  **Run the application:**

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs`.

## API Endpoints

*   `GET /api/jobs`: Retrieve all job listings.
*   `GET /api/jobs/{id}`: Retrieve a specific job by ID.
*   `POST /api/jobs`: Create a new job listing (send job data as JSON in the request body).
*   `PUT /api/jobs/{id}`: Update an existing job listing (send updated job data as JSON).
*   `DELETE /api/jobs/{id}`: Delete a job listing.

## Development Notes

*   The H2 database is used for development purposes. For production deployments, configure a persistent database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or others.
*   Future enhancements could include features like job searching, filtering, user authentication, and more robust error handling.
